- Installed MongoDB [custom mode and without Compass] and made sure the folder c:/data/bin exists.

- Opened command prompt, CD'd to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin and ran mongod. Left it running in the background.

- Played with Mongo commands: 

1. use dbname, 

2. show dbname, 

3. show collections, 

4. db.createCollection("name"), 

5. db.collectionname.insert({"key":"value"})

6. db.collectionname.find({}) - shows all the items in the collection

- Cloned the project to my desktop, CD'd into server, ran npm i and then npm start.
